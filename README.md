# communication-color
### A short quiz to help a user determine their preferred communication style. 
Originally written by me for Code Works Boise to help determine what type of communication style to use with a student when they have become stuck on a topic. Provides a percentage and a graphic representation of the result of the quiz; and also gives a short description of each communication style as represented by the colors used in the quiz. Thanks goes out to my sister, Fawn who supplied the original materials which provided the basis for this app.
